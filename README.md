# Robot Evolution Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm to evolve virtual robots that navigate through a 2D grid environment. The robots must learn to efficiently collect batteries while avoiding walls, with their behavior determined by a genetic encoding of movement patterns.

## Features
- Evolutionary algorithm with configurable parameters
- Randomized map generation with customizable dimensions
- Battery collection and energy management system
- Genetic crossover and mutation operations
- Generation-by-generation fitness tracking
- Elite preservation between generations

## Technical Details

### Configuration Parameters
```java
robotsPerGen = 500            // Number of robots in each generation
generations = 500             // Number of generations to run
topPercent = 0.5              // Percentage of top performers to preserve
tournamentSize = 20           // Number of robots in each tournament selection
mutationRate = 0.035          // Probability of gene mutation
```

### Map Environment
- 22x22 grid environment
- Walls around the perimeter
- 40% of inner cells contain batteries
- Three types of cells:
  - Empty (0)
  - Battery (1)
  - Wall (2)

### Robot Capabilities
- Energy-based lifespan
- Four-directional movement (N, E, S, W)
- Environmental sensing
- Genetic encoding of behavior patterns
- Fitness based on battery collection and survival time
